# This class is used to generate the ennemies.
# A ennemy is a random enemy scaled by the level of the character and the difficulty.
# It has a name, health, energy, stats, and loot.
# The loot is generated randomly scaled by the level of the character.
# The ennemy can be an orc, a demon, a dragon, a goblin, a skeleton, a zombie, a skeleton
